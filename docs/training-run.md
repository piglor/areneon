# Starting a training run on a generated team dataset

The generation loop draws its teams from the interim pool of committed fixture
teams unless the run config names a generated dataset (`team_dataset` in the
`TrainingRunConfig`: a directory and a dataset hash). The pool then
holds the dev and training teams of the dataset, never the validation teams, and
each team is read back through the dataset reader (the pinned engine validates
it, every hash is recomputed). A run without `team_dataset` plays the interim
pool exactly as before.

Notes on how the teams are used:

- A set that names a Mega forme starts a battle as its base forme (the engine's
  validator normalises it); the pool holds that form, and the cumulative team set
  lists its hashes. The stamped hash is over this normalised form, so a
  Mega-forme paste's raw hash differs from its stamped hash.
- Pastes that normalise identically collapse to one pool entry.
- `generation.excluded_abilities` of the run config is applied to the pool.
- The dataset is generated without `--reference`, so it deduplicates against
  nothing; its own validation split is the one the pool refuses duplicates of.

## 1. Generate the local training split

The training split is never committed. Generate a dataset into the gitignored
`.tmp/` (about a minute for the pilot, then about 1 ms per draw). The keys are
public values for a public dataset; pick fresh 64-hex strings for a new dataset.

```bash
node packages/team-dataset/scripts/generate.ts generate \
  --config config/teams/gen9championsvgc2026regmc/generator.json \
  --labels config/teams/gen9championsvgc2026regmc/labels.json \
  --format gen9championsvgc2026regmc --out .tmp/datasets/train-v1 \
  --dataset-id train-v1 --generation-key HEX64 --assignment-key HEX64 \
  --dev 200 --validation 200 --training 20000
```

Verify it and print its dataset hash (SHA-256 of the manifest hash and the sorted record hashes of every split, recomputed from the records, so any swapped, added or removed record changes it):

```bash
node packages/team-dataset/scripts/dataset-hash.ts --dir .tmp/datasets/train-v1 --format gen9championsvgc2026regmc
```

## 2. Configure the run

`config/training/public-gpu16.json` is sized for a 16 GB GPU (6 layers of width
256, 256 self-play games and 64 games against each scripted baseline per
generation, 8 games in parallel). The encoder holds up to 8 moves per Pokémon
(`max_moves`), because Mimic, Sketch and Transform can show a Pokémon more moves
than its set holds; it refuses a Pokémon that shows more than `max_moves`, so a
run fails closed rather than dropping a move. Copy it, then change:

- `seeds.run_key`: a fresh name for every run (it names the battle seeds, the
  team draws and each Episode's collection record);
- `team_dataset.dataset_hash`: the hash printed above (`path` is relative to
  the repository root, where the driver runs).

The config is hashed as a whole, so a change is a new run.

## 3. Start the run

The learner runs from the separate GPU environment (`ml/gpu-env/README.md`); the
policy worker stays on CPU torch from the root environment.

```bash
ml/gpu-env/.venv/bin/python -m areneon_ml.loop run --config my-run.json \
  --run-dir .tmp/runs/my-run --engine-data fixtures/showdown/gen9championsvgc2026regmc/engine-data.json \
  --generations 10 --worker-python .venv/bin/python
```

A run with a `team_dataset` starts `packages/team-dataset/scripts/play-generation.ts`
for each generation; one without starts the bridge's own script. The driver
resumes a killed run from the last committed generation.
